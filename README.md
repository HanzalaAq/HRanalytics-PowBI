Overall Insights
-Low salaries + lack of career progression are the main causes.
-Younger to mid-career employees (26â€“35) are leaving most.
-Certain roles (Sales, Lab Tech, Research) are high-pressure and poorly compensated, leading to exits.
-Early attrition (within 1 year) suggests onboarding, expectations, or company culture issues.

Conclusion:
Employees are leaving primarily due to low compensation, limited career growth, and role-specific pressures. To reduce attrition, the company should restructure salary slabs, improve career development opportunities, and address job satisfaction issues in Sales and Technical roles.
